## Good Functions and Where They Are Located

# FatReader.cpp

  Most all of these functions seem to pull and read the directories on the SD card, but I don't fully understand all it's using      

    dirName(...);

    printEntryName(...);    

    FatReader::ls(...);

    FatReader::open(...);
 
    FatReader::readDir(...);

    FatReader::rewind();

# FatStructs.h

  Defines all the different types of directory names and FAT entries

# SdInfo.h

  Defines all the different states for what to do with an SD card

# SdReader.cpp & SdReader.h

  Redefines all different SD states

  Funtions to read and send things to Sd card

    SdReader::init(...);

# WaveHC.cpp & Wave.HC.h

  Playbuffers, pauses, plays, stops, software volume control, and formatting

    WaveHC::play();
